# Week 1 - Bank App

Simple console banking system (my very first Java project).

### Features
- Create account
- Deposit / Withdraw money
- Check balance
- Display account info

### How to run
Just run `BankApp.java`

→ Choose options 1–6 in the menu.  
No files, no dependencies - pure Java basics.
